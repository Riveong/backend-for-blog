# About this repository 🔍
This repository is a backend RESTAPI application for my svelte portfolio project. [Click here](https://github.com/Riveong/Svelte-Portfolio) for the front end and full version fo the website.

## Stacks and the idea
The idea behind this application is to use JSON file to make blog. This JSON file is a good way to go because of the efficiency of the cost it gave to me as the dev and the creator.  
> will the JSON file thingy will be permanent thing or you will be able to change yourself from being cheapskate?  
yes, I want to use either firebase or supabase in the future. That means if I do use one of them, I don't need this backend app no more.

Stacks that I use:
- Fastify  
yes that's it 💀
